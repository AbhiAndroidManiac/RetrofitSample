# RetrofitSample2

Introduction
The above android application project  is the implementation of the Retrofit2 Http client, which is type safe, and quite easy to implement.  Type safe basically means that if your data type is of x and x doesn't support operation y, then the operation y(x) will not be performed on x.  And the implementation of the retrofit becomes quite easy as well since there are multiple tools available online which can convert your json response into datamodel.
